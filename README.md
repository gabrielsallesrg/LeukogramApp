# LeukogramApp

This was before I started studying Material Design, so I know it is ugly.

This android app was made as my Uni Final Project. It helps to count and store the ammount of each cell. Then you can share (send to the professor or to your own email). This app can reduce the costs of acquiring and fixing the usual equipament.
Currently needs to be updated to Material Design and MVP.
